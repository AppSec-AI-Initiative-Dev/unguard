## Local development

### Prerequisites

The payment-service uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for dependency management and packaging.<br>
To set up the development environment, you need to:
1) have poetry installed on your machine
2) run `poetry install` in the root directory of the payment-service
