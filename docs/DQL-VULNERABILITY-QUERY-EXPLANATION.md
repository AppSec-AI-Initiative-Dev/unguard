# DQL Vulnerability Query Explanation

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of a Dynatrace Query Language (DQL) query designed to count open, non-muted vulnerabilities across monitored entities.

## Complete Query

```dql
fetch security.events
| filter dt.system.bucket=="default_securityevents_builtin"
     AND event.provider=="Dynatrace"
     AND event.type=="VULNERABILITY_STATE_REPORT_EVENT"
     AND event.level=="ENTITY"
// filter for the latest snapshot per entity
| dedup {vulnerability.display_id, affected_entity.id}, sort:{timestamp desc}
// filter for open non-muted vulnerabilities
| filter vulnerability.resolution.status=="OPEN"
     AND vulnerability.parent.mute.status!="MUTED"
     AND vulnerability.mute.status!="MUTED"
// count unique vulnerabilities
| summarize {`Open vulnerabilities`=countDistinctExact(vulnerability.display_id)}
```

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. Data Source Selection
```dql
fetch security.events
```
**Purpose**: Retrieves all records from the `security.events` table, which contains security-related events including vulnerability reports in Dynatrace.

**Context**: The `security.events` table is the primary data source for security monitoring, vulnerability management, and threat detection in Dynatrace environments.

### 2. Initial Event Filtering
```dql
| filter dt.system.bucket=="default_securityevents_builtin"
     AND event.provider=="Dynatrace"
     AND event.type=="VULNERABILITY_STATE_REPORT_EVENT"
     AND event.level=="ENTITY"
```
**Purpose**: Narrows down the data to specific types of security events.

**Filter Breakdown**:
- `dt.system.bucket=="default_securityevents_builtin"`: Focuses on events from the default security events bucket
- `event.provider=="Dynatrace"`: Only includes events generated by Dynatrace (excludes third-party security tools)
- `event.type=="VULNERABILITY_STATE_REPORT_EVENT"`: Specifically targets vulnerability state reports
- `event.level=="ENTITY"`: Filters for entity-level events (as opposed to process or host-level events)

### 3. Deduplication for Latest State
```dql
| dedup {vulnerability.display_id, affected_entity.id}, sort:{timestamp desc}
```
**Purpose**: Ensures only the most recent vulnerability state per entity is considered.

**Functionality**:
- Groups records by the combination of `vulnerability.display_id` and `affected_entity.id`
- Sorts by `timestamp desc` (newest first)
- Keeps only the first (most recent) record for each unique combination
- This prevents counting the same vulnerability multiple times if there are multiple state reports

### 4. Status and Mute Filtering
```dql
| filter vulnerability.resolution.status=="OPEN"
     AND vulnerability.parent.mute.status!="MUTED"
     AND vulnerability.mute.status!="MUTED"
```
**Purpose**: Focuses only on actionable vulnerabilities that require attention.

**Filter Criteria**:
- `vulnerability.resolution.status=="OPEN"`: Only includes vulnerabilities that haven't been resolved
- `vulnerability.parent.mute.status!="MUTED"`: Excludes vulnerabilities where the parent vulnerability is muted
- `vulnerability.mute.status!="MUTED"`: Excludes vulnerabilities that are directly muted

**Muting Context**: In Dynatrace, vulnerabilities can be muted to suppress alerts for known issues that are acceptable risk or false positives.

### 5. Final Count Aggregation
```dql
| summarize {`Open vulnerabilities`=countDistinctExact(vulnerability.display_id)}
```
**Purpose**: Produces the final count of unique open vulnerabilities.

**Functionality**:
- `countDistinctExact()`: Counts unique values exactly (vs. approximate counting)
- Uses `vulnerability.display_id` to ensure each unique vulnerability is counted only once
- Results in a single row with the total count of open vulnerabilities

## Query Output

The query returns a single result with one column:
- **Open vulnerabilities**: The exact count of unique, open, non-muted vulnerabilities across all monitored entities

## Use Cases

This query is particularly useful for:

1. **Security Dashboard**: Providing a high-level metric for security posture
2. **Compliance Reporting**: Tracking the number of unresolved security issues
3. **Risk Assessment**: Understanding the current vulnerability exposure
4. **Trend Analysis**: When run periodically, it helps track vulnerability management progress
5. **Alert Thresholds**: Can be used to trigger alerts when vulnerability counts exceed acceptable levels

## Related to Unguard

In the context of the Unguard application (an intentionally vulnerable microservices demo), this query would help monitor:

- Vulnerabilities in the Java services (proxy-service, microblog-service, profile-service)
- .NET service vulnerabilities (ad-service, membership-service)  
- Container and dependency vulnerabilities across all services
- Real-time security posture of the intentionally vulnerable environment

This type of monitoring is essential even in demo environments to understand the actual security impact and ensure controlled exposure to vulnerabilities.

## Performance Considerations

- The `dedup` operation can be computationally expensive on large datasets
- Consider adding time range filters (e.g., `| filter timestamp > now() - 7d`) for better performance
- The `countDistinctExact` function is precise but can be slower than approximate counting on very large datasets

## Security Context

This query specifically focuses on **loaded vulnerabilities** - security issues in running processes and applications that are actively monitored by Dynatrace. This makes the results particularly actionable since these vulnerabilities represent actual runtime risk rather than theoretical static analysis findings.
